[Xitami is a webserver from iMatix Corporation
sprl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xitami), developed mainly during
the late 1990s and early 2000s.  It was briefly [rebooted as "X5" in
about 2009](https://xitami.com/), using similar princples but new
technology -- but that version did not proceed past an alpha version.

Xitami 2.x has mostly not been developed since around 2004.  The
latest (last?) version based on the Xitami 2.x source can be found at:
